:small_orange_diamond: [AK Maju Xpress Web-Based System](#)

- The AK Maju Xpress System is a web-based platform designed to streamline operations for AK Maju Resources Sdn. Bhd., featuring authentication, inventory management, orders, invoicing, and reporting. Our team used MySQL, Bootstrap, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON to build an efficient system.
  
:small_orange_diamond: [KTDI Event Management System](https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/tree/main/project/project/sec01/curiousity)

- My team and I developed the KTDI Event Management System to streamline event planning for the KTDI Student Residential College Committee (JKM), KTDI staff, and UTM Johor students. We went through key phases, from proposal planning to creating system documents (SRS, SDD, STD) and designing a prototype in Figma.
