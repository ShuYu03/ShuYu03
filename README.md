## :memo: Project :memo: 
:small_orange_diamond: [AK Maju Xpress Web-Based System](#)

The AK Maju Xpress System is a web-based platform designed to streamline operations for AK Maju Resources Sdn. Bhd., featuring authentication, inventory management, orders, invoicing, and reporting. Our team used MySQL, Bootstrap, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON to build an efficient system.
  
:small_orange_diamond: [KTDI Event Management System](https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/tree/main/project/project/sec01/curiousity)

My team and I developed the KTDI Event Management System to streamline event planning for the KTDI Student Residential College Committee (JKM), KTDI staff, and UTM Johor students. We went through key phases, from proposal planning to creating system documents (SRS, SDD, STD) and designing a prototype in Figma. 

:small_orange_diamond: [HearMySign Mobile Application Prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzpbbfb1aYY)

My team developed HearMySign, an app that bridges communication between sign language users and non-signers. We went through phases like proposal, design, prototyping, and evaluation to refine the user experience. 

:small_orange_diamond: [Financial Data Analysis using Tableau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZLTfcAt8Wo)

My team developed three interactive Tableau dashboards to analyze sales trends, profit by segment and country, and the impact of discounts on profitability. These dashboards highlight top-performing regions, discount effects, and seasonal patterns.

:small_orange_diamond: [The Impact of Midwifery Personnel on Infant Mortality Rates using Python](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x9mS4nS3pps2WRXXMzIGlnbPtFv6D34q/view?usp=embed_facebook)

My team and I analyzed the link between midwifery personnel availability and infant mortality rates using Python. We cleaned and processed data, performed analysis and visualization, and applied machine learning to identify patterns. 

:small_orange_diamond: [COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State in United States using R Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeGShuKZgdA)

My team used RStudio to analyze relationships between COVID-19 variables through one-sample tests, correlation, regression, and ANOVA. These methods helped us verify claims and uncover patterns in the data. 

:small_orange_diamond: [FluencyBot (AI-Powered English Speaking App) Botpress Prototype](#)

My team developed FluencyBot, an AI-powered app that helps users improve their spoken English by providing real-time feedback on grammar and fluency. We applied AI concepts like knowledge representation, state space search, and intelligent agent design to build a functional prototype. 

:small_orange_diamond: [Restaurant Booking System using C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jasoyog7oDM)

My team developed a Restaurant Booking System in C++ using object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Working together, we built a system that simplifies table reservations.

:small_orange_diamond: [MyPerfume Ordering and Billing System using Java](#)

The MyPerfume Ordering and Billing System is a Java application that simplifies perfume ordering and billing. I applied OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling, along with data structures such as vectors and array lists.

:small_orange_diamond: [Hospital Patient Management System using Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=040VGHLbyYE)

My team developed a Hospital Patient Management System in Java, using Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) and Round Robin (RR) scheduling to manage Consultation and ICU patients. This project gave me hands-on experience with scheduling algorithms, real-world system simulation, and teamwork in problem-solving.
